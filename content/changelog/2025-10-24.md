- **Default project setup**

  We've updated default project creation to start with a single `main` branch instead of separate `production` and `development` branches. This change responds to user feedback that many prefer to control their own branch creation strategy, as branches can impact storage usage and costs.

  We still recommend a production-development branch workflow if it fits your use case. With this approach, you can do development work on a dedicated branch, use migrations to merge schema changes back to `main` when ready, and leverage the [reset from parent](/docs/guides/reset-from-parent) feature to keep your development branch in sync with the latest changes from `main` before starting work on your next feature.

  As always, we'd love to hear what you thinkâ€”reach out to us on our feedback channel or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/92vNTzKDGp).
