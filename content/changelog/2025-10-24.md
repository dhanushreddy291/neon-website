## Child branch storage now capped at logical data size

- We've introduced a storage billing cap for child branches. Previously, child branches storage cost was based on all data changes over time. Now, you're billed for the minimum of accumulated changes or your actual data size, ensuring you never pay more than the logical size of your data on the child branch. This change makes child branch storage costs more predictable and helps avoid charges from long-lived branches.
