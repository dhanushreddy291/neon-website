title: Data API refresh, new snapshot restore options, set expiration dates for branches, and more

## Refreshed Data API - now with dedicated config page

The Data API (Beta) now has a dedicated page accessible from your project sidebar, making it easier to discover and enable. You can now enable the Data API for any database (not just the default). The setup asks you to enable **Neon Auth** as your auth provider by default (recommended), but you can choose **Other provider** if you have your own JWKS URL to configure (or skip this step until later). We're also making significant improvements under the hood in preparation for GA. Stay tuned!

## Better snapshot restore flexibility

You can now restore to your root branches' snapshots from any branch in your project, giving more flexibility in restoring data for your workflows. Each snapshot card now also includes the expiration date, for better clarity.
