## Monthly usage recap

Stay informed about your Neon usage with our new monthly usage recap emails. These reports provide a clear breakdown of your account's usage across all billing metrics—including compute, storage (root branches, child branches, and instant restore), extra branches, and public network transfer—along with associated costs. The recap makes it easy to track your spending and identify opportunities to optimize costs. Check your inbox at the end of each billing period.

## pgvector v0.8.1 support for Postgres 18

We've added support for [pgvector](/docs/extensions/pgvector) v0.8.1 on Postgres 18 (Beta). This new version of `pgvector` adds support for Postgres 18 and improves `binary_quantize` function performance.

## Pulumi provider for Neon

A [Pulumi provider for Neon](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/neon/api-docs/database/) is now available, enabling you to manage your Neon infrastructure as code using Pulumi. This community-developed provider lets you define and provision your Neon projects, branches, databases, and roles alongside your other cloud resources in a unified, declarative configuration. For a complete walkthrough, see our [Neon with Pulumi](/docs/guides/neon-pulumi) guide.

## SST support with Pulumi

With the new Pulumi provider, you can now use Neon with [SST](https://sst.dev/), the popular full-stack framework for building modern applications on AWS. Define your Neon databases in your `sst.config.ts` and seamlessly link them to your application components, giving you type-safe access to your database connections throughout your stack.
