## Weekly Neon usage reports

Paid plan users will soon begin receiving weekly usage reports on Mondays. These reports provide month-to-date usage and costs across all billing metrics—including compute, storage, extra branches, and network transfer—helping you track spending and optimize costs before your monthly bill is finalized. For cost optimization strategies for Neon, please refer to our [Cost optimization guide](/docs/introduction/cost-optimization).

## Pulumi provider for Neon

A [Pulumi provider for Neon](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/neon/api-docs/database/) is now available, enabling you to manage your Neon infrastructure as code using Pulumi. This community-developed provider lets you define and provision your Neon projects, branches, databases, and roles alongside your other cloud resources in a unified, declarative configuration. For a complete walkthrough, see our [Neon with Pulumi](/docs/guides/neon-pulumi) guide.

## sst.dev support with Pulumi

With the new Pulumi provider, you can now use Neon with [SST](https://sst.dev/), the popular full-stack framework for building modern applications on AWS. Define your Neon databases in your `sst.config.ts` and seamlessly link them to your application components, giving you type-safe access to your database connections throughout your stack. For more details, see our [Neon with SST](/docs/guides/neon-sst) guide.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Neon CLI**
  - We updated the Neon CLI to version 2.15.1, which adds support for numeric characters in parent branch names and fixes CSRF authentication errors experienced by some users. To upgrade your Neon CLI version, please refer to our [upgrade instructions](https://neon.com/docs/reference/cli-install#upgrade).
- **Neon API**
  - Fixed an issue where database rename requests through the [Update branch](https://api-docs.neon.tech/reference/updateprojectbranchdatabase) endpoint could fail with a `could not configure compute node` error when the target database had active connections. The database rename operation now drops existing connections to the database before renaming, which sllows the request to complete successfully.
- **Postgres extensions**
  - We've added support for [pgvector](/docs/extensions/pgvector) v0.8.1 on Postgres 18 (Beta). This new version of `pgvector` adds support for Postgres 18 and improves `binary_quantize` function performance.
  - The `neon` Postgres extension, which provides functions and views for gathering Neon-specific metrics, has been updated to version 1.9. To learn more about the extension, see [The neon extension](/docs/extensions/neon).
- **Neon Console**
  - Fixed an issue that prevented creating Postgres 18 projects in HIPAA-enabled organizations. Note that HIPAA cannot be enabled on Postgres 18 projects, as Postgres 18 is currently in preview.
- **Snapshot restore**
  - The [multi-step snapshot restore](/docs/guides/backup-restore#multi-step-restore) flow now includes **Restored to** and **Restored from** fields that show the target date/time and source snapshot for the restore operation. At the end of the restore flow, a **Go to branch** button lets you navigate directly to the backup branch created by the restore operation.
