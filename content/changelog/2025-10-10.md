title: Weekly usage emails, pgvector 0.8.1, Pulumi and sst.dev support

## Track your usage weekly

To help you stay on top of your usage and costs, paid plan users will now receive weekly usage reports every Monday at the email address associated with your Neon account. These reports provide full visibility into your month-to-date usage across all billing metrics—including compute, storage (root branches, child branches, and instant restore), extra branches, and public network transfer—along with costs as they accumulate throughout the month. This gives you the insight you need to manage your Neon usage proactively and make adjustments before your monthly bill is finalized. For strategies on optimizing costs, see our [Cost optimization guide](/docs/introduction/cost-optimization).

## pgvector v0.8.1 support for Postgres 18

We've added support for [pgvector](/docs/extensions/pgvector) v0.8.1 on Postgres 18 (Beta). This new version of `pgvector` adds support for Postgres 18 and improves `binary_quantize` function performance.

## Pulumi provider for Neon

A [Pulumi provider for Neon](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/neon/api-docs/database/) is now available, enabling you to manage your Neon infrastructure as code using Pulumi. This community-developed provider lets you define and provision your Neon projects, branches, databases, and roles alongside your other cloud resources in a unified, declarative configuration. For a complete walkthrough, see our [Neon with Pulumi](/docs/guides/neon-pulumi) guide.

## sst.dev support with Pulumi

With the new Pulumi provider, you can now use Neon with [SST](https://sst.dev/), the popular full-stack framework for building modern applications on AWS. Define your Neon databases in your `sst.config.ts` and seamlessly link them to your application components, giving you type-safe access to your database connections throughout your stack. For more details, see our [Neon with SST](/docs/guides/neon-sst) guide.
