## Configure scale to zero in the console

Scale plan users can now adjust their scale to zero timeout directly in the Neon Console. Simply select **Edit compute** from the menu on the **Compute** tab to set a custom timeout. The Scale plan allows you to set this as low as 1 minute, a setting that was previously only available via the Neon API.

## Quick presets for branch expiration

Managing temporary branches is now easier with convenient preset options. When creating or configuring a branch, choose to automatically expire it after 1 hour, 1 day, or a week. No need to manually calculate and select a specific date and time.

## New NAT gateway IP addresses

We've added new NAT gateway IP addresses in the AWS US East (N. Virginia) region to expand infrastructure capacity. If you have external IP allowlists that enable connections from external services into Neon, **update those allowlists soon to include the new addresses** to avoid connectivity issues.

See our [Regions documentation](/docs/introduction/regions#aws-nat-gateway-ip-addresses) for the complete list of NAT gateway IPs for all regions.

## New VPC endpoint service for Private Networking

We've added a new VPC endpoint service address for Private Networking in the AWS US East (N. Virginia) region. If you're setting up Private Networking in the `us-east-1` region, you can now use the additional endpoint service address for enhanced infrastructure capacity and reliability.

For the complete list of VPC endpoint service addresses by region, see our [Private Networking guide](/docs/guides/neon-private-networking).

## E2E testing with Neon branches

Run end-to-end tests using isolated database branches. We've published guides showing how to use Neon's database branching with **Playwright** and **Cypress** to create isolated test environments for every pull request. Each PR gets its own database branch with automated schema migrations, ensuring your E2E tests run against the exact schema changes you're testing.

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Postgres extension updates**
  - The [pg_graphql](/docs/extensions/pg_graphql) extension has been updated to version 1.5.11. This extension adds a GraphQL API layer directly to your Postgres database, allowing you to query your database using GraphQL.

        To upgrade from a previous version of the extension, follow the instructions in [Update an extension version](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions#update-an-extension-version).

- **Instant restore and snapshots**
  - Updated default instant restore settings for new projects. Instant restore lets you recover your database to any point in time within your configured window. Previously, new projects were set to the maximum restore window for their plan; now they default to 6 hours for Free plan projects and 1 day for paid plans. You can adjust your restore window anytime in your project settings.
  - Fixed an issue where selecting a restore time using the datepicker would unexpectedly include the current time's seconds and milliseconds. Restore times now set seconds and milliseconds to zero when specified to the minute.
  - Fixed an issue where the **Create snapshot** button incorrectly appeared on the Backup & Restore page when a non-root branch was selected. Snapshots can only be created from root branches (branches without a parent).

- **Neon Launchpad**
  - Fixed an issue where usage limits for Neon projects created using Neon Launchpad ([neon.new](https://neon.new/)) were not reset after being claimed to a Neon account.

- **Data API**
  - Data API and IP Allow cannot be used together. To enable Data API, you must first disable IP Allow on your project.
