## AI rules for Neon (Beta)

We've released AI rules to help AI coding tools write better code for Neon. These context rules provide best practices and guidance for using Neon Auth, Drizzle ORM, the Serverless Driver, TypeScript and Python SDKs, the Neon API, and Neon Toolkit. Add them to your AI coding assistant to get more accurate, production-ready code suggestions. This feature is in betaâ€”we'd love your feedback on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/92vNTzKDGp).

For Claude Code users, we've also published a comprehensive cheatsheet based on how Neon engineers use Claude Code daily. It covers workflow tips, custom commands, MCP servers, sub-agents, and more to help you get the most out of your AI coding experience.

## E2E testing with Neon branches

Run end-to-end tests with confidence using isolated database branches. We've published a comprehensive guide showing how to use Neon's database branching with Playwright to create isolated test environments for every pull request. Each PR gets its own database branch with automated schema migrations, ensuring your E2E tests run against the exact schema changes you're testing. Our Cypress guide is coming soon.

## New NAT gateway IP addresses

We've added new NAT gateway IP addresses in the AWS US East (N. Virginia) region to expand infrastructure capacity. If you have external IP allowlists that enable connections from external services into Neon, **update those allowlists soon to include the new addresses** to avoid connectivity issues.

See our [Regions documentation](/docs/introduction/regions#aws-nat-gateway-ip-addresses) for the complete list of NAT gateway IPs for all regions.

## New VPC endpoint service for Private Networking

We've added a new VPC endpoint service address for Private Networking in the AWS US East (N. Virginia) region. If you're setting up Private Networking in the `us-east-1` region, you can now use the additional endpoint service address for enhanced infrastructure capacity and reliability.

For the complete list of VPC endpoint service addresses by region, see our [Private Networking guide](/docs/guides/neon-private-networking).

<summary>**Fixes & improvements**</summary>

- **Postgres extension updates**
  - The `pg_graphql` extension has been updated to version 1.5.11. This extension adds a GraphQL API layer directly to your Postgres database, allowing you to query your database using GraphQL.

    To use the `pg_graphql` extension with Neon, check out our [pg_graphql guide](/docs/extensions/pg_graphql) for more information.

    To upgrade from a previous version of the extension, follow the instructions in [Update an extension version](/docs/extensions/pg-extensions#update-an-extension-version).

- **Instant restore**
  - Updated default instant restore settings for new projects. Instant restore lets you recover your database to any point in time within your configured window. Previously, new projects were set to the maximum restore window for their plan; now they default to 6 hours for Free plan projects and 1 day for paid plans. You can adjust your restore window anytime in your project settings.
  - Fixed an issue where selecting a restore time using the datepicker would unexpectedly include the current time's seconds and milliseconds. Restore times now set seconds and milliseconds to zero when specified to the minute.

- **Scale to zero**
  - Scale plan users can now configure the scale to zero time for a compute directly in the Neon Console by selecting **Edit compute** from the menu on the **Compute** tab. The Scale plan allows you to set a minimum scale to zero time of 1 minute, which was previously only configurable via the Neon API.

- **Neon Launchpad**
  - Fixed an issue where usage limits for Neon projects created using Neon Launchpad ([neon.new](https://neon.new/)) were not reset after being claimed to a Neon account.

- **Branch expiration**
  - Setting branch expiration is now simpler with quick preset options. Choose to expire a branch after 1 hour, 1 day, or 7 days instead of manually selecting a specific date and time.
