## Neon Launchpad updates

We've shipped several improvements to [Neon Launchpad](/docs/reference/neon-launchpad) â€” our tool for instant Postgres database provisioning without configuration or account creation.

- **Streamlined CLI**: The `npx neondb --yes` command now runs entirely in your terminal with no browser interaction or CAPTCHA required
- **New claim command**: We added a `neondb claim` command that lets you claim databases directly from the CLI, this command looks for the look for a `PUBLIC_LAUNCHPAD_CLAIM_URL` by default
- **Better Vite integration**: The plugin now outputs a named export for improved auto-completion, adds `envPrefix` support for public environment variable prefixes, and adds Vite 7 to `peerDependencies`

Try Neon Launchpad at [neon.new](https://neon.new/) or get started with `npx neondb --yes`.
