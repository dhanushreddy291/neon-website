title: Data API updates, Neon Launchpad improvements, and more

## Data API updates

We've made several major improvements to the Data API (Beta):

### _Build your first app_ quick start

The Data API page now includes a new **Build your first app** tab with a streamlined setup flow. This new tab lets you clone our note-taking demo app directly from the UI using your project's credentials, making it easy to get started with the Data API.

Once set up, you can follow our tutorials to learn [Data API queries](/docs/data-api/demo) and [Row-Level Security](/docs/guides/rls-tutorial) using the same [demo app](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/neon-data-api-neon-auth).

### SQL-to-PostgREST converter tool

We've added a new converter tool to help you translate existing SQL queries into PostgREST syntax. Useful for developers migrating from direct SQL queries or learning PostgREST patterns.

Try the converter [here](/docs/data-api/sql-to-rest).

### Rust-based architecture for better performance

We've rebuilt the Data API from the ground up in Rust while maintaining 100% PostgREST compatibility. This new architecture delivers better performance, multi-tenancy support, and improved resource efficiency, while maintaining the same PostgREST API.

Learn more in our [Data API docs](/docs/data-api/get-started) or read about the architectural improvements in our [blog post](https://neon.com/blog/a-postgrest-compatible-data-api-now-on-neon).

## Neon Launchpad updates

We've shipped several improvements to [Neon Launchpad](/docs/reference/neon-launchpad) â€” our tool for instant Postgres database provisioning without configuration or account creation.

- **Streamlined CLI**: The `npx neondb` command now runs entirely in your terminal with no browser interaction or CAPTCHA required.
- **New claim command**: We added a `neondb claim` command that launches the claim URL in your browser, letting you easily claim the database to your Neon account if you want to keep it.
- **Better Vite integration**: The plugin now outputs a named export for improved auto-completion, adds `envPrefix` support for public environment variable prefixes, and adds Vite 7 to `peerDependencies`.

Try Neon Launchpad at [neon.new](https://neon.new/) or get started with `npx neondb`.

- **Snapshots API**
  - Added `restored_from` and `restored_as` fields to branch API responses, providing better tracking of snapshot restore relationships for AI agents and automated workflows. These fields show which snapshot was used to restore a branch and which branch was replaced during restoration.
