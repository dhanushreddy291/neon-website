## More projects on the Free plan

We've increased the Neon project limit on the Neon Free plan, giving you more flexibility to build and experiment with multiple projects. This change makes it easier to learn new stacks, build AI-powered apps, ship MVPs, and explore different Postgres versions without hitting project limits.

## Get started with Neon Local and Neon Local Connect

**Neon Local** and **Neon Local Connect** bring the power of Neon's cloud database branching directly to your local development environment.

- **Neon Local** is a Docker-based proxy that creates a smart local interface to your Neon database, providing a static connection that automatically routes to your active cloud database branch.

- **Neon Local Connect** extends this with a full-featured VS Code extension, offering database schema browsing, built-in SQL editing, table data management, and branch switchingâ€”all without leaving your IDE.
