## More projects on the Free plan

We’ve doubled the Free plan project limit from 10 to 20. No more one-in, one-out—keep side projects and prototypes without hitting the limit.

## Neon MCP Server enhancements

- We introduced a new **list_shared_projects** tool that lists projects shared with the current user. For a list of all Neon MCP Server tools, see [Supported tools](/docs/ai/neon-mcp-server#supported-actions-tools).
- We improved handling and logic related to Neon org selection.
- You can now manage your Neon database directly from Claude Code using the [Neon MCP Server](https://github.com/neondatabase/mcp-server-neon) Check out our new guide to get started. It covers both remote (OAuth) and local setup options: [Get started with Claude Code and Neon Postgres MCP Server](/guides/claude-code-mcp-neon)
- Cursor user? Try the one-click Neon MCP Server install:

## Postgres `pg_repack` extension available to all Neon users

The `pg_repack` extension lets you to efficiently remove bloat by rewriting tables and indexes online, with minimal locking.

Previously, enabling `pg_repack` required opening a support ticket so our team could grant you permission on the `repack` schema. That's no longer necessary — you now have access by default. No Support ticket means the extension is available to everyone, including Free plan users.

## Get started with Neon Local and Neon Local Connect

**Neon Local** and **Neon Local Connect** bring the power of Neon's cloud database branching directly to your local development environment.

- **Neon Local** is a Docker-based proxy that creates a smart local interface to your Neon database, providing a static connection that automatically routes to your active cloud database branch.

- **Neon Local Connect** extends this with a full-featured VS Code extension, offering database schema browsing, built-in SQL editing, table data management, and branch switching—all without leaving your IDE.
