## More projects on the Free plan

We’ve increased the Free plan project limit from 10 to 20. This gives you more room to experiment and keep all your side projects in one place—whether you’re trying new stacks, building AI apps, shipping MVPs, or exploring Postgres versions—without having to decide which project to delete.

## Get started with Neon Local and Neon Local Connect

**Neon Local** and **Neon Local Connect** bring the power of Neon's cloud database branching directly to your local development environment.

- **Neon Local** is a Docker-based proxy that creates a smart local interface to your Neon database, providing a static connection that automatically routes to your active cloud database branch.

- **Neon Local Connect** extends this with a full-featured VS Code extension, offering database schema browsing, built-in SQL editing, table data management, and branch switching—all without leaving your IDE. It also manages the underlying Neon Local Docker container for you and adds a control panel to create, switch, and reset branches right from your editor.

## `pg_repack` is now available to all Neon users

Previously, enabling `pg_repack` required opening a Support ticket so our team could grant the `neon_superuser` role permission on the `repack` schema. That's no longer necessary — the `neon_superuser` role now has access by default. No Support ticket means the extension is available to everyone, including Free plan users.

Learn more about how to use it in our docs: [/docs/extensions/pg_repack](/docs/extensions/pg_repack)

## Claude Code MCP integration guide

You can now manage your Neon database directly from Claude Code using natural language, made possible by the [Neon Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server](https://github.com/neondatabase/mcp-server-neon).

Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI tool that brings the power of Claude AI to your command line. With the new MCP integration, you can interact with your Neon databases using conversational English directly from your terminal - create branches, run migrations, execute queries, and more.

The guide covers both remote (OAuth) and local setup options, making it easy to get started regardless of your preferred authentication method.
