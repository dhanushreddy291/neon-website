## Generate apps locally with open-source models

**App.build**, Neon's open-source reference architecture for code generation platforms, now supports running **open-weight LLMs** via **Ollama**, **LMStudio**, and **OpenRouter**—letting you build apps without API costs, rate limits, or external data sharing. You can also access large open-weight models through OpenRouter. [Learn more ›](https://neon.com/blog/app-build-supports-open-source-models-locally)

## Branch expiration now available to all users

Branch expiration is now available to all Neon users! Previously available only to Early Access participants, you can now set an expiry date to automatically delete branches at a specified time, helping keep projects clean and reduce storage costs for temporary branches.

Set the `expires_at` timestamp when creating or updating branches via the API, CLI, or Neon Console, up to 30 days ahead of time. When that time comes, the branch and its compute endpoints are permanently deleted.

**Use cases**

- CI/CD pipelines with ephemeral test branches
- Time-boxed feature development
- Temporary demos or testing environments
- AI workflows requiring automated cleanup

## Enhanced Neon Local development experience

Neon Local now supports connecting to existing Neon branches, giving you more flexibility in your local development workflow. Previously, Neon Local only supported creating ephemeral branches that were automatically deleted when the container stopped.

**What's new:**
- **Connect to existing branches** — Use the `BRANCH_ID` environment variable to connect your local development environment to any existing Neon branch
- **Streamlined VS Code extension** — The Neon Local Connect extension now focuses on core connection and branch management, with database operations redirected to the Neon Console for a more integrated experience

Whether you're working on feature branches, collaborating with your team, or need persistent development environments, Neon Local now adapts to your workflow. [Learn more about Neon Local ›](/docs/local/neon-local)
