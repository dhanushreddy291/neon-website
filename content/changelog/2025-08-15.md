title: Generate apps locally with open-source models, branch expiration for all users, and more

## Generate apps locally with open-source models

**App.build**, Neon's open-source reference architecture for code generation platforms, now supports running **open-weight LLMs** via **Ollama**, **LMStudio**, and **OpenRouter**—letting you build apps without API costs, rate limits, or external data sharing. You can also access large open-weight models through OpenRouter. [Learn more ›](https://neon.com/blog/app-build-supports-open-source-models-locally)

## Branch expiration now available to all users

Branch expiration is now available to all Neon users! Previously available only to Early Access participants, you can now set an expiry date to automatically delete branches at a specified time, helping keep projects clean and reduce storage costs for temporary branches.

Set the `expires_at` timestamp when creating or updating branches via the API, CLI, or Neon Console, up to 30 days ahead of time. When that time comes, the branch and its compute endpoints are permanently deleted.

**Use cases**
- CI/CD pipelines with ephemeral test branches
- Time-boxed feature development
- Temporary demos or testing environments
- AI workflows requiring automated cleanup
