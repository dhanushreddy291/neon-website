## New usage-based pricing plans

We’ve introduced fully **usage-based pricing** for Neon paid plans — starting at just $5/month. Pay only for what you use, based on:

- **Compute** (CU-hours)
- **Storage** (GB-months)
- **Additional branches** (branch-hours, only when exceeding included limits)
- **Instant restore history** (GB-months of data changes)

The **Free plan** stays strong, with key improvements:

- **Storage** increased from 0.5 GB total to **0.5 GB per project**.
- **Compute** is now **50 CU-hours per project** each month, instead of a single account-wide limit.
- As part of the update, **all Free plan projects have been reset to 50 CU-hours for the remainder of the current month**, regardless of usage so far.

**Note to users:**

- **Free plan users** are already on the new plan with the updated limits above.
- **Paid plan users** keep their current plan and rate unless they choose to switch in the Neon console.

For details, see the [pricing page](https://neon.com/pricing) and read the [blog post](https://neon.com/blog/new-usage-based-pricing).

## Generate apps locally with open-source models

**App.build**, Neon's open-source reference implementation for agent builders, now supports running **open-weight LLMs** via **Ollama**, **LMStudio**, and **OpenRouter**, letting you build apps without cloud API dependency or associated costs. You can also access large open-weight models through [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/). [Learn more ›](https://neon.com/blog/app-build-supports-open-source-models-locally)

## Branch expiration now available to all users

Branch expiration is now available to all Neon users! Previously available only to Early Access users, you can now set an expiry date to automatically delete branches at a specified time, helping keep projects clean and reduce storage costs for temporary branches.

Set the `expires_at` timestamp when creating or updating branches via the API, CLI, or Neon Console, up to 30 days ahead of time. When that time comes, the branch and its compute endpoints are permanently deleted.

**Use cases**

- CI/CD pipelines with ephemeral test branches
- Time-boxed feature development
- Temporary demos or testing environments
- AI workflows requiring automated cleanup

To learn more, refer to our [guide](/docs/guides/branch-expiration).

## Enhanced Neon Local development experience

**Neon Local**, a service that lets you work with your Neon cloud database locally from Docker, now supports connecting your app to any existing branch in your Neon project. Previously, Neon Local only supported creating ephemeral branches that were automatically deleted when the container stopped.

Additionally, **Neon Local Connect**, the VS Code extension for Neon Local (also supported in Cursor, Windsurf, and other VS Code-compatible editors), now includes:

- **Database Schema view** – Browse databases, schemas, tables, columns, and relationships right from your IDE. Quickly inspect structures, explore relationships, and perform table actions like querying, truncating, or dropping—all without leaving your editor.
- **Built-in SQL Editor** – Run queries directly in your IDE, view and filter results in a table, export data, and see execution stats. Perfect for testing changes or debugging without switching to an external SQL client.

These updates make it easier to explore your database, run queries, and manage schema changes without leaving your development environment.

## New NAT gateway IP addresses

We've added new NAT gateway IP addresses in the AWS Europe (Frankfurt) region to expand infrastructure capacity. If you have external IP allowlists that enable connections from external services into Neon, **update those allowlists soon to include the new addresses** to avoid connectivity issues.

### New IP addresses

**AWS Europe (Frankfurt) – `aws-eu-central-1`**

- 3.66.63.165
- 18.194.181.241
- 52.58.17.95

See our [Regions documentation](/docs/introduction/regions#aws-nat-gateway-ip-addresses) for the full list of NAT gateway IPs.

## New extension: online_advisor

We've added support for a new Postgres extension. Developed by our very own [Konstantin Knizhnik](https://github.com/knizhnik), the `online_advisor` extension provides actionable tips for faster queries, based on your real workload:

- Recommend indexes for heavy filtering  
- Suggest extended statistics when estimates are off  
- Flag queries that should use prepared statements

## Neon + Better Stack integration guide

Neon’s [OpenTelemetry (OTEL) integration](https://neon.com/docs/guides/opentelemetry) now has a step-by-step guide for sending your project’s metrics and Postgres logs to [Better Stack](https://betterstack.com/)—an observability platform for unified logging, monitoring, and alerting.  
Thanks to contributor [Dhanush Reddy](https://github.com/dhanushreddy291), you can follow the new guide here: [Getting started with Neon and Better Stack](https://neon.com/guides/betterstack-otel-neon).
