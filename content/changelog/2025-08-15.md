## Generate apps locally with open-source models

**App.build**, Neon's open-source reference architecture for code generation platforms, now supports running **open-weight LLMs** via **Ollama**, **LMStudio**, and **OpenRouter**—letting you build apps without API costs, rate limits, or external data sharing. You can also access large open-weight models through OpenRouter. [Learn more ›](https://neon.com/blog/app-build-supports-open-source-models-locally)
