## New horizontal navigation in Neon Docs

We've introduced a new horizontal navigation bar in the Neon Docs to make it easier to find what you need. You can now quickly scan across the top-level menus, each with a dropdown of related topics. When you select a menu item, a dedicated left-hand sidebar for that topic area opens, giving you a clear view of everything available within that section.

This update improves discoverability and helps you move through the docs more efficiently.

### Community: Neon Testing – Vitest library for integration tests

We’re excited to share **[Neon Testing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/neon-testing)**, a community-built library by [Mikael Lirbank](https://www.lirbank.com/) that makes it easy to run integration tests against real Neon databases.

Instead of relying on mocks or maintaining local test databases, Neon Testing uses Neon’s branching to provision **disposable Postgres test databases** for each test file. This means your tests run against the same schema and constraints as production, catching issues that mocks can miss (like unique constraint failures and transaction rollbacks).

- **Backup & restore**
  - On the **Backup & restore** page on the Neon Console, snapshots are now listed with a more user-friendly branch name instead of the branch ID value.
  - The **Restore branch modal** now shows the new branch expiration time that will be set when restoring a branch that is configured to expire.
- **Neon Console**
  - We adjusted the warning mesage on the **Edit compute** modal about connection brief disruptions when changing the compute size. The warning message now only appears when compute size values are modified.
