## New horizontal navigation in Neon Docs

We've introduced a new horizontal navigation bar in the Neon Docs to make it easier to find what you need. You can now quickly scan across the top-level menus, each with a dropdown of related topics. When you select a menu item, a dedicated left-hand sidebar for that topic area opens, giving you a clear view of everything available within that section.  

This update improves discoverability and helps you move through the docs more efficiently.
