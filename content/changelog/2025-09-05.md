## New VPC endpoint service for Private Networking

We've added a new VPC endpoint service address for Private Networking in the AWS Europe (Frankfurt) region. If you're setting up Private Networking in the `eu-central-1` region, you can now use the additional endpoint service address for enhanced infrastructure capacity and reliability.

For the complete list of VPC endpoint service addresses by region, see our [Private Networking guide](/docs/guides/neon-private-networking).
