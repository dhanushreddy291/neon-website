Boost your productivity with AI context rules for Neon. These rules help AI assistants understand Neon's features, leading to more accurate code suggestions and fewer common mistakes.

If you're using **Claude Code**, install the comprehensive Neon plugin that bundles Skills, MCP integration, and all context rules in one package. For other AI tools like **Cursor**, use the individual `.mdc` context rule files.

## For Claude Code

If you're using Claude Code, install the Neon plugin to get Skills, MCP integration, and all the context rules in one package:

## Individual AI rules

For other AI tools like Cursor, you can use these individual `.mdc` context rule files. Copy them to your AI tool's custom rules directory â€” the format is tool-agnostic and works with any AI assistant that supports context rules.

## How it works

AI rules are `.mdc` files that specify which types of files they apply to (such as `*.tsx` or `schema.sql`). When you're working with a matching file, your AI tool automatically applies the relevant rules to provide better suggestions.

### Example: AI rules in action

Here's a practical example using [Cursor](https://www.cursor.so). A developer has implemented authentication in their server-rendered page and wants to confirm best practices:

**Developer query**: _"Using the neon-auth.mdc rule, how do I secure a server-rendered page?"_

![Screenshot of Cursor applying the neon-auth.mdc rule](/docs/ai/ai-rules.png)

The AI confirms that using `stackServerApp.getUser({ or: "redirect" })` is the correct approach for server-side authentication, providing additional context and explanation.

## Add rules to your project

All `.mdc` files are available in the [Neon AI Rules toolkit repository](https://github.com/neondatabase-labs/ai-rules). Copy the files you need to your project's `.cursor/rules` folder (or your AI tool's equivalent):

```text
.cursor/
  rules/
    neon-auth.mdc
    neon-serverless.mdc
    neon-drizzle.mdc
    neon-toolkit.mdc
    neon-typescript-sdk.mdc
    neon-python-sdk.mdc
    neon-api-guidelines.mdc
    neon-api-projects.mdc
    neon-api-branches.mdc
    neon-api-endpoints.mdc
    neon-api-organizations.mdc
    neon-api-keys.mdc
    neon-api-operations.mdc
```

Most AI tools will automatically apply these rules when you're working with Neon-related code. You can also reference them explicitly in prompts for more targeted assistance.
