[Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/) is Google's data visualization and business intelligence platform. This guide explains how to connect your Neon Postgres database to Looker Studio using a PostgreSQL data source.

<Steps>

## Get your database connection string

1. In the Neon Console, select the **project** and **branch** you want to connect to.
2. On the **Project dashboard**, click **Connect**.
3. Click **Show Password** and copy the connection string.

For more details, see [Connect from any application](/docs/connect/connect-from-any-app).

## Add a PostgreSQL data source in Looker Studio

1. In Looker Studio, **Create** > **Data Source**.
2. Search for and select the **PostgreSQL** connector, and authorize it.
3. In the **Basic** section, fill in the fields using the details from your connection string.

   For example, if your connection string is:

   ```bash
   psql 'postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_aaaaaaaaaaaa@ep-quiet-mountain-a1t1firv-pooler.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require'
   ```

   You would enter:
   - **Host name or IP**: `ep-quiet-mountain-a1t1firv-pooler.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech`
   - **Port (optional)**: Leave blank
   - **Database**: `neondb`
   - **Username**: `neondb_owner`
   - **Password**: `npg_aaaaaaaaaaaa`

## Configure SSL settings

1. Ensure **Enable SSL** is checked.
2. Leave **Enable client authentication** unchecked.

## Upload the server certificate

1. Download the `isrgrootx1.pem` file from https://letsencrypt.org/certs/isrgrootx1.pem. For more information about SSL certificates, see [Connect to Neon securely](/docs/connect/connect-securely).
2. In Looker Studio, upload the `isrgrootx1.pem` file using the **Upload** button next to the **Server Certificate** box.
