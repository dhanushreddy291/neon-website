## A Backend That Aligns With How Agents Work

**Serverless Postgres at the core.**
Neon’s backend is powered by a serverless Postgres engine built on separated compute and storage. It provisions instantly, scales automatically, and idles to zero when not in use - perfect for the bursty, on-demand workloads that agents create.

**Integrated services for full-stack backends.**
Around that core, Neon includes Auth and a PostgREST-compatible Data API, so agents and developers can assemble complete, production-ready backends without stitching multiple services together.

**API-first and programmable.**
Every capability - provisioning, quotas, branching, and fleet management - is exposed through the Neon API, giving developers and agents precise control over their environments and usage at scale.

**Version-aware by design.**
Neon’s copy-on-write storage makes time travel effortless. Branching, snapshots, and point-in-time recovery enable undo, checkpoints, and safe experimentation across millions of databases.

## The Neon Stack For Agents: What You Get

- **Serverless Postgres with separated storage and compute.** The foundation of Neon: production-grade Postgres that’s scalable, reliable, and cloud-native.
- **Instant autoscaling for truly no-management databases.** Neon adjusts compute automatically so agents never run out of capacity.
- **Scale to zero for built-in cost control.** Idle projects cost nothing, making it sustainable to support large fleets.
- **Snapshots API to back checkpoints and versioning features.** Create lightweight checkpoints to let agents experiment and roll back safely.
- **Instant point-in-time recovery.** Revert to any moment instantly, so mistakes never become blockers.
- **Quota and fleet control APIs to manage apps programmatically.** Provision, monitor, and cap usage across large fleets with simple API calls.
- **Auth with RLS compatibility and simple, secure defaults.** Authentication built in, with support for row-level security and common auth flows.
- **Data API to expose queries directly per environment.** Every branch and project comes with its own RESTful endpoint.

## How It Looks Like in Practice: The Experience

<FeatureList icons={['agent', 'speedometer', 'branching', 'database', 'lock', 'scale', 'api']}>

### Agent creates an app

A vibe coder imagines an app. Your agent builds it, full-stack. Real apps need databases, not just UI scaffolds or code snippets. Neon lets your agent add a fully functional Postgres database to every app it builds. Whether they're prototyping, testing, or deploying, your users get persistence out of the box.

### Gets a working database instantly, with no friction

Neon provisions the database behind the scenes via API, so your user never has to leave your flow or sign up for an external service. Provisioning is instant, invisible, and integrated. Your agent simply requests a project, and Neon returns a live Postgres instance. The result is a seamless experience where databases just show up, and the vibe never breaks.

### Agent adds auth

Neon makes it easy to add secure, production-ready authentication and access control to agent-generated apps using Neon Auth. Your users don't have to wire it up themselves – auth just works, right out of the box. One less thing to worry about, and one more reason their app feels real.

### Infra stays affordable as more apps are created

Imagine spinning up a new RDS instance every few seconds: you'd blow your budget on the first invoice. Most managed databases aren't built to support thousands of isolated instances, especially not cheaply. Neon's serverless architecture solves this. Databases automatically scale to zero when idle and wake up instantly. You don't pay unless the database is active or stores data.

### Branching unlocks time travel + safety

Neon branching makes it easy to build full-version history into your platform. Your agent can snapshot schema and data at any moment, and vibe coders can roll back to a working version of their app, preview earlier states, or safely test changes.

### Stay in control with quotas

The Neon API allows you to track usage per project and branch with detailed endpoints for compute time, storage, and network I/O. You can enforce quotas via the API to match your free or paid plans, giving you full control over how resources are consumed.

### It's all just Postgres

The most-loved database by developers is also the most practical choice for agents. Postgres is flexible, powerful, and battle-tested. Neon is simply Postgres: with all the extensions, full SQL syntax, and everything your agent already understands.
